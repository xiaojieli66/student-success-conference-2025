Their willingness to help, genuine care, and efficiency have made it so much easier to navigate any challenges on campus. Every time I’ve needed assistance, they’ve been there with patience and understanding, and I honestly can’t thank them enough for making such a positive difference in my college experience.","positive","staff support, personal experience"
3,"The online registration is very bad and frustrating. When i attempt to register for credit and on-credit classes, the system does not allow me to register for the classes i have chosen. We are in 21st century and the system PVCC is using is like the initial advent of internet. Please upgrade/update this archaic system so the online registration becomes an smooth process rather than frustration, and in some cases giving up and not signing up for anything. Other than this issue i have been happy to have PVCC here and be able to attend. People are generally kind and helpful. Thank you.","mixed","online registration, system issues, staff"
4,"Need better advisement. Advisors are great but it is so hard to get an appointment with an advisor at your earliest convenience. You can only find an appointment 3 weeks out, which was past a deadline I was needing advisement for.","mixed","advising, appointment availability"
5,"Thank you for all the support and help. My experience has been very positive, and I am very satisfied with everything.","positive","overall satisfaction, support"
