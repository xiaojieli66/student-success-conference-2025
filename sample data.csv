1,"Ana and Christie are amazing and made my experience so much better than I expected! They went above and beyond always!"
2,"My advolisor really helped me decipher the schedule code. I did have to withdraw from a class due to not enough information and really bad instruction. But so far my other classes have been great. I wish there were more night classes in person. And the gym not being open long is not great. I feel like every time I cone to campus to resolve an issue the area I need is closed. Bookstore hours are not friendly to my full time working schedule."
3,"The quality of teachers at PVCC is really great and I love that the smaller class sizes allow for more one on one student teacher connection. The only poor experience I've had is limited class options for upper level classes in my major, sometimes I'll sign up for a class and a week before the semester starts the class will be cancelled and I'll have to change my schedule around last minute."
4,"The online registration is very bad and frustrating. When i attempt to register for credit and on-credit classes, the system does not allow me to register for the classes i have chosen. We are in 21st century and the system PVCC is using is like the initial advent of internet. Please upgrade/update this archaic system so the online registration becomes an smooth process rather than frustration, and in some cases giving up and not signing up for anything. Other than this issue i have been happy to have PVCC here and be able to attend. People are generally kind and helpful. Thank you."
5,"I’m truly grateful for the incredible support and kindness the staff consistently show. Their willingness to help, genuine care, and efficiency have made it so much easier to navigate any challenges on campus. Every time I’ve needed assistance, they’ve been there with patience and understanding, and I honestly can’t thank them enough for making such a positive difference in my college experience."
