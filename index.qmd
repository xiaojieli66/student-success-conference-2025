## Example: RNL Survey

- The Ruffalo Noel Levitz (RNL) organization conducts the **Student Satisfaction Inventory (SSI)** survey.
- It was recently administered at MCCCD in **Spring 2025**.
- We received **122 open-ended comments** from PVCC students. 

---

### Step 1: Prepare Data

- Keep the tabular format
- Remove all other columns
- Assign index

| index | comment |
|:------|:--------|
|   1   |XXXXXXXXX|
|   2   |XXXXXXXXX|
|   3   |XXXXXXXXX|

---

### Step 1: Prepare Data

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
kable(sample[c(1:3), ]) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 27)
```

---

### Step 2: Remove Personally Identifiable Information

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
kable(sample_name_masked[c(1:3), ]) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 27)
```

---

### Step 3: Write a Prompt 
<br>
<span style="font-size:75%; line-height:1.2; display:inline-block;"> "You are analyzing open-ended comments from a student satisfaction survey. <br><br>
Task 1: **Determine the overall perception** of each comment toward the college. Choose one of the following categories: (a) **positive**, (b) **negative**, (c) **neutral**, or (d) **mixed**. <br><br>
Task 2: **Identify the topics** mentioned in each comment. Use clear and descriptive labels such as advising, class availability, faculty, etc. Please create new topic labels as needed. List all relevant labels, separated by commas, such as 'advising, class availability'. <br><br>
Return the results in a **table** with the following three columns: **index**, **perception**, and **labels**."</span>

---

### Step 4: Send the Prompt to ChatGPT

|     | Direct use                                   | Programmatic use                                   |
|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| How to use| Chat in the web interface or app  | Make an API call through a script ([sample R code](https://github.com/xiaojieli66/student-success-conference-2025)) |
| Setup     | Create an account or sign in to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and choose a plan (Free/Plus/Business)     | Create an account or sign in to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/), get an [API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), and [load some credits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview)       |
| Privacy   | Turn off [Improve the model for everyone](https://chatgpt.com/#settings/DataControls) in settings if using a free or Plus plan  | Not used for training models by default |
| Cost      | Per-user subscription (\$20/month for Plus; \$25 or \$30/month for Business)               | Usage-based  |

---

### Step 5: Review Results

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
kable(comments_ai[c(1:3), ]) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 22)
```

---

### Repeat Step 3-5 As Needed
Revise the Prompt for Desired Labeling

<span style="font-size:55%; line-height:1.2; display:inline-block;"> "You are analyzing open-ended comments from a student satisfaction survey. Your task is to code each comment using none, one, or more of the following standardized labels: <br> <br>
**Campus Climate** – Comments about the general environment or sense of belonging on campus (e.g., feeling cared for, welcomed, respected, or included). <br>
**Advising** – Comments about academic advising, advisor helpfulness, or access to advisors. <br>
**Classes/Schedules** – Comments about class offerings, availability, scheduling, or course registration timing. <br>
**Faculty/Instruction** – Comments about instructors, teaching quality, or classroom experiences. <br>
**Facilities** – Comments about physical campus resources such as parking lots, gyms, cafeterias, buildings, or classrooms. <br>
**Academic Program** – Comments about specific academic programs or majors (e.g., Nursing, Music, Education).  <br>
**Admissions/Registration** – Comments about enrollment, admissions, or registration processes. <br>
**Other Services** – Comments about campus services other than Advising or Admissions/Registration, such as Veterans Services, Counseling, Athletics, Library, Tutoring, Career Services, Disability Services, or Student Clubs. <br> <br>
Instructions: Please do not create new labels. If a comment fits multiple labels, include all relevant ones separated by commas, such as 'Campus Climate, Academic Program'. The output should be a table with two columns: index and labels."</span>

### Repeat Step 3-5 As Needed
Check Results Again
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
kable(comments_ai_2[c(1:3), ]) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 22)
```
